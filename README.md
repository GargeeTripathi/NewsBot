# NewsBot
NewsBot-AI-Powered News Delivery Agent
Welcome to the NewsSage Bot GitHub repository. This project was built as part of a mini hackathon challenge to develop a no-code AI agent that fetches, summarizes, and delivers news automatically using n8n.

Project Overview

NewsBot is a personalized news delivery automation system built using:
n8n for creating the automation workflow.
NewsAPI to fetch the latest headlines.
Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) to summarize the news.
Gmail to send summarized news articles to the user.

The bot automatically runs every day and sends short summaries of top news headlines directly to your email ‚Äî no manual search, no clutter.

üìå Features

Scheduled daily execution using Cron node.
Uses HTTP Request to pull news data from NewsAPI.
Summarizes articles using Azure OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model.
Sends summarized output via Gmail node.
Designed entirely in n8n, without writing code.

üîß How It Works

Cron Node triggers the workflow daily.
HTTP Request Node calls NewsAPI and fetches the latest articles.
Azure OpenAI Node summarizes each article (title + description).
Gmail Node sends the final result to the user‚Äôs email inbox.

‚ö† Note: This version of the bot does not use a filter. All articles fetched are sent to the summarization step.
